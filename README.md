This project demonstrates the implementation of a Machine Learning model using scikit-learn in Python. It involves loading and preprocessing a dataset, training a 
classification model (such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression), and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix. The goal is to build a 
predictive system capable of classifying or forecasting outcomes based on input data. This task showcases essential machine learning workflows including data splitting, 
vectorization, model training, and evaluation.
